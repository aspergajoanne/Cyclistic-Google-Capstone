# Cyclistic-Google-Capstone
I first used Excel to start the clean up process. I deleted any rows that had: null values, zero and negative numbers on the ride length, and the columns "ride_id, start_station_id, end_station_id, start_lat, start_long, end_lat, end_lng."
I used R to do the rest of the data cleaning and to start analyzing.
I used Tableau for my data visualization and analysis.
